# tools
daily tools and setup scripts i use to get my windows/linux systems up and running for bare minimal usage

Currently config for apps is not included (i.e. no .bashrc or .config/*) as i thought keeping this minimal might be better, once i get my conf files sorted i might start pushing some of them here
